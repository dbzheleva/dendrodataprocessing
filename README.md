This repository contains scripts intended for analysis of data from a non-friction magnetic dendrometer, originally created by the OPEnS Lab. 

This code is under active development and currently focuses on:
- Data Plotting: Generating graphs to visualize dendrometer measurements over time.
- Data Cleaning: Addressing common issues such as sensor alignment, noise removal, and simple anomaly detection.


We plan to add:
- Gap Filling: Automatically interpolate or handle missing measurement intervals.
- Advanced Analysis: Provide more robust insights into tree trunk fluctuation.
